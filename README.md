# Hello, i am Jonas Vanhulst üëã

As first year electronics ICT engineer, i am very happy that i could make this nice and working soldering station.

## issues ‚úçÔ∏è
By testing the result i found a problem while powering the opamp. The opamp didn't receive the 5V so i checked the PCB design and i found a problem with connecting the 5V to the Opamp.
So for solving this problem a singel wire was placed between the opamp and a 5V pin.
